                <h1>Who is Still Works?</h1>
                
                <p>Still Works is an architecture, design, and building practice focused on affordable, intentional, and joyful design. Born from a love of rural community and ingenuity, Still Works strives to serve our neighbors and their projects at any scale, from sheds to social housing.</p>
                
                <p>As of now, Still Works is a sole practitioner studio owned and operated by me, Greg Goldstone (pictured here, age 4). I grew up in the small town of Cambridge, NY, and though I lived in Connecticut, Pittsburgh, New York City, and Providence in between, I moved back to New York State and the rural Hudson Valley in 2024. I founded Still Works in 2025 out of a desire to practice architecture in and for my community. I am a licensed architect in New York State.</p>
